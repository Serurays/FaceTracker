# FaceTracker

I changed the code of the FaceDetection tutorial to resolve the errors I got, such as not being able to process a numpy error, which I needed to copy the sample image for.

I also made the splitting and directory creation processes automatically to enable you to directly run the code for that part.

Huge Thanks to Nicholas Renotte for this amazing tutorial: https://youtu.be/N_W4EYtsa10?si=LWMnCJIv_7gDxWjS
